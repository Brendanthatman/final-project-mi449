# MSU Dashboard

This is the final project for MI449 (Advanced Web Development). The project is creating a dashboard for MSU students to have important information quickly at their fingertips. Time, date, weather and sports data is all live and from the host client/API's. Other data is generated with example data populated from a group-made database.
